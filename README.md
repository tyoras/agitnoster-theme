# A(git)noster Theme for Oh My Zsh
Agitnoster theme customizes your zsh prompt to show detailed information about the current git repository status.

It is based on [agnoster theme](https://gist.github.com/3712874) included in [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and [bash-git-prompt](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt).
